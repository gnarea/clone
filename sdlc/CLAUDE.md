## Agents

An agent is a job description: the priorities it optimises for, and the principles by which it delivers on them.

```markdown
---
name: <slug>
description: <Role Title>. Use to <primary deliverables>; or to review <artefacts>.
skills:
  - <skill relevant to every task this role performs>
---
# <Role Title>

(Responsibilities.)

## Priorities

(Ordered: earlier beats later when they conflict.)

## Principles

(How to deliver on the priorities, in broad terms.)

## Escalation

(When and how to escalate issues to the user or parent agent.)
```

## Skills

Anything prescriptive (conventions, workflows, templates, checklists) belongs in a skill.

## Conventions

- Agents and skills MUST NOT name another agent, a role, or a person, so that they compose with any caller.
- Every rule MUST come from how I work, rather than from received wisdom.
- Observe the /ghost-writing:ghost-writing skill, and avoid AI-isms (e.g., "load-bearing", "first-class").
