# Cloud infrastructure

## Provisioning

- Every resource MUST be declared as code and applied from a repository. Anything provisioned by hand MUST have tracked work to codify or remove it.
- Infrastructure code MUST be partitioned by domain (e.g., `iam`, `network`, `alerts`), never by construct type.
- Continuous integration MUST validate the code.
- A rule about infrastructure that can be checked mechanically (e.g., no storage is public, no credential is long-lived) MUST be enforced as policy in continuous integration, rather than left to review.

## Least privilege

- Each workload MUST have its own identity, granted only the permissions it uses, enumerated rather than taken wholesale from a predefined role.
- Where the provider supports conditional grants, access MUST be constrained by resource, not only by role.
- A workload MUST obtain its credentials from the platform's identity service where possible, rather than from a stored secret.
- Every service MUST be reachable only by its intended clients.
- The deployment of every server MUST be immutable.

## Cost

- Every estate MUST have a budget, with alerts on both actual and forecast spend.
- Usage that an attacker can drive up and that we can't cap (e.g., inbound traffic at a proxy, DNS lookups) MUST be on an unmetered plan, so that a flood can't run up the bill.
